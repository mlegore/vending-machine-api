# Introduction

Welcome to your GitHub coding test!

We know you've already spent plenty of your personal time during interviews.
Worry not; this is the last step of our process and it is designed to be
relatively quick. We appreciate both your time and patience!

We've hand-crafted a coding challenge in our problem domain, for your intellect
to chew on. We've designed the challenge to test your problem solving skills in
addition to your communication skills. Please, take the time to read through this
entire README.  

Good luck!

## Instructions
